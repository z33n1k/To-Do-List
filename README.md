# To-Do-List
Just a simple python script that organizes to do's by the closest date to help you with your schedules

Reminder that im a beginner to programming so the script might not be optimized, nested, etc...
Just thought i could provide my first project to the community with what I'm learning

About the project:

"todo.py" stores all the modules
todo.txt stores the to do's
temp.txt it's a copy of the to do text file and its used on the deletion of to do's
finished.txt stores all the to do's that are deleted (finished)
main.py imports the module functions and calls them

I choose to leave the main.py small to make it easier to organize myself
